# Ruby Recursion: Merge Sort

## Project Overview
This project is a part of the "Project: Recursion" lesson from The Odin Project. The assignment focuses on implementing the merge sort algorithm in Ruby using recursion. Merge sort is a highly efficient sorting technique and a great example of the divide and conquer strategy in algorithm design.

## Objective
The primary objective of this assignment is to understand and apply the principles of recursion in sorting algorithms. By implementing merge sort, I will gain a deeper insight into how complex problems can be broken down into simpler, manageable sub-problems.

## Key Learning Points
- **Recursion in Sorting Algorithms**: Learning how recursion can be applied in sorting algorithms, specifically merge sort.
- **Divide and Conquer Strategy**: Understanding the divide and conquer approach and how it improves algorithm efficiency.
- **Ruby Programming**: Enhancing Ruby coding skills, focusing on algorithmic thinking and problem-solving.

## Assignment Details
- **Task**: Build a method `#merge_sort` that takes an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
- **Examples**:
  - Input: `[3, 2, 1, 13, 8, 5, 0, 1]` should return `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`.
  - Input: `[105, 79, 100, 110]` should return `[79, 100, 105, 110]`.

## Getting Started
To start with this assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**: Clone this repository and set up the Ruby development environment.
2. **Implementation**: Begin by understanding the merge sort algorithm. Implement the `#merge_sort` method in Ruby.
3. **Testing**: Test the method with various arrays to ensure it sorts correctly.
4. **Analysis**: Analyze the efficiency of your implementation and understand the role of recursion in the algorithm.

## Conclusion
This assignment is an excellent opportunity to delve into the world of algorithmic programming and understand how recursion plays a crucial role in efficient problem-solving. Merge sort is not just a sorting algorithm but a concept that embodies the essence of divide and conquer, a fundamental strategy in computer science.

I look forward to applying these concepts to more complex problems and further enhancing my understanding of algorithmic thinking and Ruby programming.
